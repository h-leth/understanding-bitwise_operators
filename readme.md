# Understanding Bitwise operators
---
The purpose of this was understanding how the bitwise operators code writen by [Jon Gjengset](https://github.com/jonhoo) in a youtube video about open source maintenance worked.

The code is writen as an example in issue [#287](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/issues/287#issuecomment-1666801994) in the [Inferno](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno) repository
